[B][U][SIZE="4"]FAQ[/SIZE][/U][/B]
[B][U]Why is the security patch older than the latest AOSP patch?[/U][/B]
CAF focus on delivering the latest hardware patches and are usually about a month behind Google on security patches, on the other hand, Google is usually a month or more behind on them on caf patches (sometimes months). No point in complaining about it, if you want the latest security patch, go with an AOSP based rom (like LineageOS),  if you want latest Qualcomm optimizations for our hardware as well as fixes, go with caf, it's as simple as that.
